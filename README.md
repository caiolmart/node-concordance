# arXiv Paper Classification

In this project I will try to predict the subject of a collection of papers from arXiv using Graph Neural Networks.

The dataset, `ogbn-arxiv` is from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Downloading instructions can be found [here](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-arxiv).


## Requirements

This project uses Pytorch and Pytorch Geometric.

For the installation with GPU enabled a simple `pip install -r requirements.txt`
won't work.

Follow the instructions on:
